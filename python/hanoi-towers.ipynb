Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n    2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another \n       stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.\n    3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n  \n  This class will print out the moves that it takes to solve the puzzle\"\"\"\n\n  def __init__(self):\n        self.counter = 0\n\n  def hanoi(self, n, org, aux, dst):\n    \"\"\"n: Number of disks (above a given level) to be moved\n       org: origin rod\n       dst: destination rod\n       aux: auxiliary rod\n       The key point to understand in the recursion is to think about the number of disks above a given level,\n       not the amount of disks below a given level\"\"\"\n    if n == 1: \n       self.counter += 1\n       print('{0}->{1}'.format(org, dst))\n    else:\n       self.hanoi(n-1, org, dst, aux)\n       self.hanoi(1, org, aux, dst)\n       self.hanoi(n-1, aux, org, dst)\n\ntower = Tower()\ntower.hanoi(3, \"org\", \"aux\", \"dst\")"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3}],"metadata":{"name":"Hanoi_Towers","notebookId":6872},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
